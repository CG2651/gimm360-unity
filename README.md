- 3D looping sound attached to controls image in beginning scene
- 2D sound triggered when player touches alien in the gameplay scene (i couldn't get it to trigger the sound from the alien)
- 2D ambient sound in the gameplay scene
- 3D sound triggered when the player shoots a line onto a building in the gameplay scene

- i added two reverb zones in the first two rooms of the tower in the city scene because that's the only place with a room the player can walk into
- i added one reverb zone in the alley, next to the red ladder, on the right of the player. i changed it to the city preset and it doesn't sound drastic, compared to the room preset.
